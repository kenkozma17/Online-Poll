# Online Poll Web App
A customized online poll web application that stores user feedback according to survey answered. This was a side project given to me by a client in September 2018.

# How it works
The user may select 5 surveys/polls that will guess something about them after they answer the survey or poll. This resembles the type of games or surveys that are on facebook.
